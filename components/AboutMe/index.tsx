        Sometimes life is rough. You may want to make changes in your life, but
        may be unsure about where to start. I assist individuals and couples in
        better understanding the struggles they have been facing through
        improving their awareness of cognitive and behavioral patterns that may
        have become maladaptive.

        I have practiced for the past eleven years with an emphasis on trauma
        stemming from neglect and abuse. I also have experience working with
        children with autism and their families in educational and residential
        settings.
